## Instructions on How to Use the Dataset

### Loading the Dataset
To begin working with the dataset, you first need to load it into your environment. Here's how you can do it in Python:

```python
# Load the dataset
file_path = 'path/to/your/dataset.txt'  # Update this to the actual path of your dataset
with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
    names = file.read().splitlines()

# Print the first 10 names
print(names[:10])
```

### Analyzing the Dataset
You can perform various analyses with this dataset. For example, to count the occurrences of each name:

```python
from collections import Counter

# Count occurrences
name_counts = Counter(names)

# Print the 5 most common names
print(name_counts.most_common(5))
```

### Using the Dataset in a Machine Learning Model
